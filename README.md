Contains files for time and memory profiling of cell segmentation methods. For time profiling, all analysis can be done through the pipeline-timing-new-segmentation.ipynb notebook. Results are saved and can also later be analyzed using the compare-masks.ipynb notebook in the soma-segmentation-exploration repostiory. For memory_profiling, follow the directions at the end of the pipeline-timing-new-segmentation.ipynb notebook. Memory profiling of the new version of caiman is performed using the .py files end in "_new". Memory profiling of the old version of caiman is performed using the files ending in "_old.py". Suite2p memory profiling performed using files ending in "_suite2p.py".
